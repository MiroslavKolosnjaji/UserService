# UserService
The UserService microservice facilitates user management within an application. It employs reactive programming principles and follows a clean architecture approach
to ensure scalability and maintainability

## Limitations and Use Case
This microservice was developed as a practice project to explore reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.  
It is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool to demonstrate modern Java development practices and principles.

## Technologies Used:
- __Spring Framework:__ Core Framework for building enterprise Java applications.
- __Project Lombok:__ Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java.
- __Spring WebFlux:__ Provides reactive programming support for building asynchronous, non-blocking web applications.
- __Spring Security:__ Ensures robust authentification and authorization mechanisms for securing user data.
- __Spring Data R2DBC:__ Spring Data module for reactive database access using R2DBC
- __MapStruct:__ Used for mapping between domain entities and DTOs.
- __JUnit5:__ Testing framework for unit and integration testing in Java.
- __Spring Boot Test:__ Provides testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- __R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity):__ Reactive database driver for relational databases.
- __H2 Database:__ In-memory relational database for development and testing purposes
- __JSON:__ Data interchange format for communication between the client and the server.

### Conclusion:
This UserService microservice embodies modern Java development practices, leveraging reactive programming,
clean architecture, and robust testing methodologies to deliver efficient and scalable user management functionality.
